To integrate PhonePe in a Flutter app without using `flutter_upi` package, you can use the 
PhonePe SDK for flutter which provides a simple and easy to use interface for PhonePe Payments in your 
Flutter app.

Here are the steps you can follow to integrate PhonePe in your Flutter app:

1. Add the `phonepe_sdk` dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:
```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
   phonepe_sdk: <latest_version>
```
2. Import the `phonepe_sdk` library in your Flutter app:

```dart
import 'package:phonepe_sdk/phonepe_sdk.dart';
```
3. Initialize the PhonePe SDK with your merchant ID and merchant key:
PhonePeSdk.init(merchantId:'<your_merchant_id>', merchantKey:'<your_merchant_key>');
4. Use the `startTransaction` method of the `PhonePeSdk` class to initiate a PhonePe payment:
```dart
final PhonePeResponse response = await PhonePeSdk.startTransaction(
                                      transactionId:'<your_transaction_id>',
                                      amount:'1.0',
                                      currency:'INR',
                                      app:PhonePeApps.PhonePe,
                                      deepLink: '<your_deep_link>',
                                      customerPhoneNumber:'<your_customer_phone_number>',
                                      customerEmail:'<your_customer_email>',
                                      customerFirstName:'<your_customer_first_name>',
                                      customerLastName:'<your_customer_last_name>',
                                      paymentType:PaymentType.Payment,
                                      paymentModes: PaymentModes.All,
                                      isTransactionFlow: false,
                                      isBackgroundTransaction: false,
                                    );
```

The `startTransaction` method takes several parameters such as the transaction ID, the amount,
the currency, the customers phone number, email address, first name and last name, the payment type,
the payment modes, and flags for the transaction flow and background transactions

5. Check the response of the  `startTransaction` method to see if the transaction was successful or not:
```dart
if(response.status == PhonePeResponseStatus.Success){
  // Payment was successful
} else if(response.status == PhonePeResponseStatus.Error){
  // Payment failed
} else if (response.status == PhonePeResponseStatus.Cancelled) {
  // Payment was cancelled by the user
}
```
The `transactionId` property of the `startTransaction` function in the PhonePe SDK is a Unique identifier for the transaction that is generated by the merchant. It is used to identify the transaction and to verify the transaction later on.

The transaction ID should be generated by the merchant and should be unique for each transaction. It can be any string that conforms to the merchant's transaction ID format, but it should be unique to avoid conflicts with other transactions.

The transaction ID is typically used to identify and track the transaction within the merchant own systems.

To get the transaction ID, you will need to generate it within your own system. You can generate the transaction ID using any method that suits your needs, such as generating a random string, using a sequence number, or using a combination of different values.

Here is an example of how you can generate a random transaction ID in python:
```python
import random
import string
def generate_transaction_id():
  return ''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits,k=32))
```

This function generates a random string of 32 characters using uppercase letters and digits. You can use a similar approach in your own system to generate a unique transaction ID.
In the Python example given in the previous answer, the empty string ('') is passed as the separator to the join function, which is called on the result of the random.choices function.

The join function is used to concatenate a list of strings into a single string, with the separator string inserted between each element. In this case, the empty string is used as the separator, which means that the elements of the list will be concatenated without any separator.

For example, if the list returned by random.choices is ['A', 'B', 'C'], the join function will return the string 'ABC'.

The random.choices function is used to select a random element from a list of choices with replacement. It takes two arguments: the list of choices and the number of elements to select. In this case, the list of choices is string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits, which is a combination of the uppercase letters and digits, and the number of elements to select is 32. This means that the random.choices function will return a list of 32 randomly chosen elements from the list of uppercase letters and digits.
